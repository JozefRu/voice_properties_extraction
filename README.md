The Spafe_.py file is part of my thesis. In Spafe_py, I extract speech features from various databases that contain many .wav files of human speech.
This python file contains the extraction of speech features and their conversion into a suitable format in .csv, which is then used for further work.


Abstract of my thesis:
This thesis deals with the issue of stress level detection in human speech using advanced feature extraction methods and machine learning 
techniques. In the work, we outlined the current state of stress detection in speech and the impact of stress on human speech. Subsequently, 
we presented theoretical knowledge about the speech features, which we extracted in the practical part from available corpora of the recordings 
in Slovak and English. The practical part consists of comparing the effectiveness of these properties. In the practical Part, we used the 
Classification Learner application to implement classification models on the extracted speech features and compared their results in the detection of three 
levels of stress. We performed an overall evaluation of the used stress classification process and outlined the next direction of the work.
